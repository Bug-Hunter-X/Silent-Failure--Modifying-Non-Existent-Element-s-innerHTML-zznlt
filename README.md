This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML bug where attempting to modify the `innerHTML` of a non-existent element results in a silent failure, i.e., no error is thrown. The bug.html file shows the erroneous code, and solution.html shows how to prevent this using a conditional check before attempting the modification. This kind of bug can be hard to debug as it does not produce immediate obvious errors.  The solution involves adding a check to confirm the element's existence before manipulating its content.
